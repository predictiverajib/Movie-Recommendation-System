# Movie-Recommendation-System

The main goal of this machine learning project is to build a recommendation engine that recommends movies to users. We will be developing an Item Based Collaborative Filter. Here we will calculate similarities between different items in the dataset by using one of a number of similarity measures, and then these similarity values are used to predict ratings for user-item pairs not present in the dataset.

We are going to use the MovieLens Dataset which contains files such as movies.csv and ratings.csv file. The data consists of 105339 ratings applied over 10329 movies. Also we will make use of these four R packages- 

recommenderlab - provides an infrastructure to test and develop recommender algorithms.
ggplot2- for data visualization & is widely used for creating various aesthetics plots.
data.table- help us to interface with the JavaScript Library called â€“ Datatables.
reshape2- makes our life easy to transform data between wide and long formats.
